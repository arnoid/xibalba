name: Burrowing Red-Kneed Tarantula
description: Like most New World tarantulas, they kick urticating hairs from their
  abdomens and their back legs if disturbed, rather than bite. They are only slightly
  venomous to humans and are considered extremely docile, though, as with all tarantulas,
  allergies may intensify with any bite.
